INTRODUCTION
As a recent graduate from NIT Pondicherry, India, currently pursuing my Master's in Cybersecurity at EPITA, I am deeply passionate about the field. Cybersecurity excites me because it involves tackling real-life, high-stakes challenges, much like soldiers on the frontlines, protecting critical systems and data from constant threats. My goal is to gain hands-on experience, expand my knowledge, and contribute to defending organizations against cyberattacks.

I am a recent graduate with a profound interest in technology and a dedication to solving complex problems.

## Objective
To continuously gain knowledge, data, and experience in cybersecurity, while contributing to the organization's security operations. I am eager to learn and grow in the role of a SOC Analyst, leveraging my passion for technology and problem-solving to protect and secure digital environments.
